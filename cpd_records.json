        "Learning outcomes": "To Learn the ff:\nTaxable Supplies:\n\nThese are goods and services on which GST is charged. When you make a taxable supply, you must include GST in the price (currently 10%) and remit this amount to the Australian Tax Office (ATO). Businesses registered for GST can claim credits for the GST included in their business purchases (known as input tax credits).\nGST-Free Supplies:\n\nSome goods and services are GST-free, meaning no GST is charged. Examples include basic food items, some medical services, and educational courses. Businesses providing GST-free supplies can still claim input tax credits on purchases related to those supplies.\nInput Taxed Supplies:\n\nCertain supplies, like financial services and residential rent, are classified as input taxed. No GST is charged on these supplies, but businesses cannot claim input tax credits for purchases related to making these supplies.",
